# maxify
Maxify is a command-line tool designed to automate the deminification of JavaScript projects by leveraging sourcemap files. Unlike generic beautifiers, Maxify recreates the original directory structure and unpacks all source files to their unminified, human-readable formâ€”ideal for debugging, reverse engineering, or forensic analysis.
