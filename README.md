# maxify
Maxify is a command-line tool designed to automate the deminification of JavaScript projects by leveraging sourcemap files. 

Unlike generic beautifiers (such as the many, *many* online "paste javascript here" sites), Maxify recreates the original directory structure and unpacks all source files to their unminified, human-readable form - ideal for debugging, reverse engineering, or forensic analysis.
